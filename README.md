# coursera-machine-learning
A place for my materials for the coursera course on machine learning, including code and jupyter notebooks

## How to use this code
I set up Jupyter through Anaconda, which by default comes with all the essential python frameworks to get started.

The class requires Octave, however, so you will need to install that, as well as the octave kernel for jupyter

## Notes
As of gnuplot @5.2.2, plots from Octave in the jupyter notebooks here would not work. I had to hold gnuplot back to @5.0.6 to get plots to work without any magic.
